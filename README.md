* Wake word detection (“Wake Up”) and signing-off detection (“Turn Off”)

* Users' movie preferences for different moods can be stored by the VA.

* Creation of an activity dataset that contains the necessary information to recommend an activity based on the user's mood.

* BERT pre-trained model for detecting yes/no word variations, emotions, sentiments, and summarization of text.

* Asymmetric semantic search is used to recommend a movie based on the user’s response

* VA Geolocation is used along with the Weather API to recommend indoor or outdoor activities
